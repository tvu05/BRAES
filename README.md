Purpose/Description of this project: 
Webscraping to expedite process of collection of literature of communal roosting behavior. First step is just running the species and seeing how many relevant articles result 
to see if this project is someting we want to move forward with. 

Three main directories to take note of:  
1) Data: This file contains the excel sheet with the core land birds. This is where we are reading the data to build the search.
2) Outputs: This file contains a csv file as an excel sheet which contains the species in one column and the number of articles per species.
3) Scripts: This file contains all the R scripts where we have been writing code. There are a few scripts in there where they have been updated each time we work on them.
